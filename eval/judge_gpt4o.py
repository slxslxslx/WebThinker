JUDGE_PROMPT = """
Task
I need your help in evaluating an answer provided by an LLM against a ground truth answer for a given question. Your task is to determine if the ground truth answer is present in the LLM's response. Please analyze the provided data and make a decision.

Instructions
1. Carefully compare the "Predicted Answer" with the "Ground Truth Answer."
2. Consider the substance of the answers - look for equivalent information or correct answers. Do not focus on exact wording unless the exact wording is crucial to the meaning.
3. Your final decision should be based on whether the meaning and the vital facts of the "Ground Truth Answer" are present in the "Predicted Answer."

Input Data
- Question: {question}
- Predicted Answer: {prediction}
- Ground Truth Answer: {answer}

Output Format
You should only respond in JSON format as described below and ensure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads.
Return ONLY valid JSON.
Do NOT wrap the JSON in markdown or code fences.
Do NOT add any other text before or after the JSON.

Response Format:
{{
"Explanation": "(How you made the decision?)",
"Decision": "TRUE" or "FALSE"
}}

Your output:
